Chicago is among the first cities in the US to engage Service Designers to understand stakeholder needs and design access to integrated services accessible across in-person, physical, phone, and digital platforms.<br> 
This studio project is an opportunity to explore civic service design, designing new ways for residents to access and engage with services provided by the City of Chicago.<br>

		<h2>Design Topic</h2>
<p>
Understanding a Welcome Service for Residents should be accessible, inclusive, innovative and engaging, we are going to focus on designing to meet the needs of <span>[Civic technologists partnering with the city and the open data portal]</span>. </p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>
While cities are built around services for residents, businesses, and visitors, the practice of Civic Service Design is <span>in its earliest stages.</span> <br>

Understanding the opportunity space is critical since we believe that the best services are designed <span>for real people in specific contexts.</span><br>

As the project is moving forward, we need to continuously explore how the service we designed <span>sets the tone for what it means to engage as a citizen</span>.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Explore and design ways in which residents discover and engage with City services, ordinances, and opportunities delivered in an accessible, inclusive, and innovative manner.<br>

1. <span>Get Chicagoans the services they need</span>. -Improve access to services for all Chicagoans.<br>

2. <span>Engage residents with their city and community</span>.-Build and enrich communities that use services. <br><br>

	<h1>Research</h1>
	<h2> #1 Experts interviews<br>with staffs from the city of Chicago</h2>
	<p>How we approached this broad objective, and what we did to gain insights. We connected and engaged with citizens in context through interviews and observation.<br><br>
		<span>Civic Technology Ecology enables engagement, participation or enhances the relationship between the people and government.</span></p>
	
	<h2>Stakeholders Maps</h2>
	<p>Now the city of Chicago is providing data via the open data portal. People could search, download data they want. And the government could release the data after they received a request. </p>
	<img src="img/ccc/images/B1.png" width="100%"><br><br>




<p><span>Insight 1: Growing wild<br><br>
	Civic tech projects are happening independently except getting dataset or API from the Chicago Open data portal.

<span>Insight 2: Tech internal revelry<br><br>
Although various background people are developing various topic projects, it seems like only techs show up in Chi hack night, so there is a gap between the tech community with residents.</span></p>

	<h1>Research</h1>
	    	<h2> #3 Civic Technologists<br>individual interviews</h2>
<p>Methods<br>
Interception in civic tech events<br>
Phone call informative interview<br>
In person interview <br><br>

	<span>Insight 3: Sustainability dilemma<br><br>
	Aligned with many efforts in developments, technologists know that without people from related communities their product would go a wrong path, but it's hard for them to make the residents and communities involved in their project. </span></p>


	<h1>Research</h1>
	    	<h2> #4 Residents </h2>
	    	<p>
	    		<span>Insight 4: High entry criterion<br><br>
	    		Although some residents eager to make an impact in their community, they assume they should know some tech knowledge or skills to be a part of Civic Tech. They don't know what they could bring to Civic Tech and what impact they could make.   </span></p>
<h1>Research</h1>
	    	<h2> #5 Internal collaboration<br>with other teams</h2>
	    	<p>Three other teams focus on public service, immigrant family and disabled people. So we could find a matched community for reaching out potential motivated residents and unmet needs which could be solved by civic tech. <br><br>
	    		<span>Insight 5: Civic Tech vacuum <br><br>
	    		Residents now even don't know that many civic tech groups are focusing on developing a product to solve their problems. </span></p>

make the civic tech project more sustainable?</h2>
<p><span>Problem Narrative</span><br>
Now from idea formation to launching, the real resident's involvement is too little. As the primary users in the future, without their feedback during product development, the product would fail after launching since it didn't catch the user's needs.</p>
<h1>Current Journey</h1>

<h2>Civic Tech Product Development</h2>

Since now there is a gap between civic tech and residents, so there is no current journey map. </p>

Encourage a resident transferring to a civic tech contributor<br>
Now most of the residents don’t have experience or motivation to get in civic tech project<br><br>
<span>Insights 3</span><br>
People are more likely to have the motivation to do something when they see familiar topics<br><br>
<span>Solution 3</span><br>
Matching projects by interest and experience<br>

</p>
<img src="img/ccc/images/E4.png" width="100%">

	The need from civic tech leaders is that they need residents to do user research and user testing.<br>
So I collect types of work they seek residents to do.

1. The project leader logs in by a google calendar bound email address<br>
2. The project leader creates a team calendar and binds with Chicago Civic Connect <br>
3. The project leader creates  an event in a team calendar<br>
4. The event shows up in Chicago Civic Connect as a task in the tasks list<br>
5. The project leader assigns tasks to team  contributors’ in  Chicago Civic Connect by adding contributors’ personal id, divided by semicolon<br>
6. The contributor receives a task in the tasks list<br>
7. The contributor finishes the task online or offline <br>
8. The task time has been calculated in the contributor's weekly contribution

Team leader user google or other online calendars to manager some team<br><br>
<span>Solution 5</span><br>
So to generate engagement, we need to build a system to gather contribution and show measurement.<br>

Show project total weekly contribution and personal proportion

Even if people involved in civic tech, it’s not easy for them to share the experience with others or get pride by that experience. <br><br>

They need a more objective way to show their contribution and impact without telling a subjective story<br><br>

<p>
● Identify the most critical elements of the service experience<br>
● Develop user empathy through user interviews or first-hand experience<br>
● Present their ideas in a clear, articulate, client- and human-centric model<br>
● Provide potential design concepts that deliver on their determined critical elements<br>
● Prototype concepts to communicate and refine their ideas<br>
● Provide a technical rational for success<br>
● Explore current and near-term-future technologies that enable the idea

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p><span>Feasibility</span><br>
				Build a partnership with existing civic technology events like Chi Hack Night or Open Uptown to understand the feasibility of Civic Connect Chicago<br><br>
<span>Outreach</span><br>
Some channels to reach residents that want to increase their civic engagement are high school computer science classes, community centers, and town hall or beat meetings, but more exploration on other locations or avenues can be done to increase outreach.
