			<h2>What service does Gaia provide?</h2>
			<p>

				<a id="link1" href="https://www.gaiawearables.com" target="blank"><span>Gaia's</span></a>

				mission is to create wearable smart apparel and an app system that monitors biometrics that are indicative of stress, wireless transmitting data to our associated app for early detection and notification of meltdowns. Now when a meltdown occurs, an alert is sent to the child's parent and any other caregivers as well as Alec of the the impending event. <br></p>

			<h2>What is the problem “Root Cause” you are solving?</h2>
<p>A <span>symptom</span> brought by autism named <span>“Meltdown”</span> is a problem for the autism spectrum disorder community. <br><br></p><h2>Why Meltdown is a problem:<br></h2> </div>

	    	    <div class="portfolio-details4">

<p><span>Reason 1: Hard to detect:<br></span>
	Triggers of Meltdown are various, so it’s hard and complicated to predict. <br><br>
These characteristics child with autism have make meltdown hard to manage and predict:<br>
(1) Lacking self-control and independence: Most autistics are dependent on their caregivers in daily life. They couldn’t actively address the difficulties in their life even if they’ve been aware of the problems.<br> 
(2) Hypersensitivity / Sensory Overload / Various sensitiveness: They have different levels of sensitiveness to different external factors like sound, material, and environment changes so that they couldn’t keep a peaceful mind. And those could be triggers of meltdown.<br>
(3) Communication difficulties: Most people with autism are nonverbal and not conversational if they don’t receive systematic training. They might only be able to repeat scripts in their mind taught by parents or teachers. So self-report and behavior justification could be not realistic for them.
<br>
Those are reasons why ASD communities are focusing on predicting a meltdown by technology.<br> <br> <br>

 <span>Reason 2: Negative influence (Emotional toll and physical harm):</span> <br>It would be bothersome or dangerous to child with autism, caregivers or other people when it happens in public. That’s why the ASD community want to put efforts into preventing a meltdown. <br> <br></p></div>

<p>
My user research results show that current methods for autistics themselves and caregivers focus on how to reduce the frequency of meltdown to improve their life quality in this order: </p></div><div class="container">

			<h1>Benchmark existing solution</h1>
			<h2>What is the competitive landscape?</h2>
			<p>There is a mental model for addressing meltdown is from managing factors or triggers to predicting potential stressful condition finally preventing a meltdown.<br><br>

There are some conventional and new methods for preventing a meltdown.<br><br>
<span>Conventional methods: </span><br></p>
<img src="img/gaia/images/D1.png" width="100%"><br><br>
<p>
(1) Relieving them by giving a hug or hug simulation<br>
(2) Using different things to minimize or get rid of the triggers in their life<br>
(3) Using earplugs or headphones to obstruct the sounds<br>
(4) Distracting them by iPad<br>
(5) Wearing loose clothes. </p></div>
<div class="container">
<img src="img/gaia/images/D2.png" width="100%"></div>

<div class="portfolio-details2">
	<p>
For now, there is no technology solution specifically focusing on managing or predicting meltdown, but the caregivers do have some conventional methods like writing <span>a journal</span> to record triggers or emotional changes in a day. <br><br>


<span>Some specific solutions for Hypersensitivity / Sensory Overload: <br></span>

(1) Fits of Rage or Angst (Cost of living is  $1.4 to 2.4 million, ~$60,000 annually, 3 times more than the average person)<br>
(2) Current Treatments<br>
(3) Occupational Therapist, $50-$100/hour<br>
(4) Weighted Vest, $70<br><br>

<span>Unconventional solutions:<br>
Striking competitor-empatica</span></p></div>
<div class="container">
<img src="img/gaia/images/D3.png" width="100%"><br><br></div>

<div class="portfolio-details2">
	<p>
<span>Similarities:</span><br>
Both use biometrics like ECG, EDA to detect and measure emotional changes. 
Both have wearable apparel and mobile app to provide service.<br><br>

<span>Differences:</span><br>
Gaia doesn't limit the form of design and empatica is a wrist band/watch.
Gaia has better mobile app support for reports checking and communicating.


</p></div><div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br> 
The conventional methods focus more on calming/relieving stage rather than predicting and preventing. Basically, the mearsument of emotion needs to base on biomedical signals or biometric data.

<br><br><br> <p><span>
Lacking of understanding of biometrics<br></span>

Caregivers only have access to information professional caregivers provide to them. Even if there are a bunch of products developed based on biomedical technology, they don't know those could help to understand the factors behind meltdown triggers. <br>
<br><br></p></div></div></div></div>


<div class="portfolio-details2">
<h2>2. Concerns we could eliminate<br><br> </h2><p>
<span>(1) Data and information privacy</span><br>
Some caregivers concern about the privacy of their children so they are unwilling to trust biomedical technology could help them. <br><br>
<span>(2) Untrustful stability</span><br>
In the common mind, now biotech is still in an experimental stage so they don’t want to experiment. <br><br>
<span>(3) The improvement couldn't be clear demonstrated.<br><br></span>
<span>(4) Everyone has a different standard of the condition</span><br>Like baseline or difference sensitiveness, so it’s hard to measure and manage by one model<br><br></p>
<h2>3. Hypothesis</h2><p>
<span>(1) Potential Customers<br></span>
Parent(s) of 700k children with autism living in the US (between the ages of 3 and 12) that cannot live an independent life<br><br>

<span>(2) Potential Market Estimation<br></span>
Since 2000, there has been a 119% increase in the prevalence of autism with ~3.5 million individuals in the US today. There is an addressable market of $300,000,000, and by year five we plan to capture 1% of it and year ten we look to control 50%. 
<br><br><div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
When using technology to make product design, for typical consumers, making technology understandable is very important. And also for training or habits building product, showing a clear improvement is also a big part for caregivers to acknowledge their commitment.

<span>Biomedical technology consideration:<br></span>
1. Mix and match solutions to customize for child’s needs<br>
2. Parents are likely to keep trying new technologies if they see improvements with their child<br>
3. Parents have some habits like writing journals for tracking changing or improvement<br>
4. Parents are willing to use a new product continuously if they got an improvement could be measured <br><br>


<span>Product accessibility consideration:<br></span>
Parent(s) are who cannot afford a caretaker, can afford our product<br><br>

<span>Emotional consideration:<br></span>
1. Meltdowns result in physical harm to child, parent(s), or caregivers<br>
2. Parent(s) are comfortable with using our product without concern<br>
3. Parents are more likely to try a new product if they have a better connection with other caregivers<br>
4. If the improvement is going back and forth, it would be frustrating for parents and caregivers. <br><br>
<div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
For the apparel design, the adaptbility is important since they have consideration of if the apparel is affordable or not in a long term, when they choosing wearbales.

<h1>White Space opportunities</h1>
			<h2>Identify differentiation opportunities? </h2>
			<p>
The product we are going to develop is a sensor embedded IoT compression shirt (smart apparel) with an associated mobile application to show emotional changes based on zones of regulation to provide early detection of the emotional state of an individual with autism in order to be proactive of meltdowns for the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) community.<br><br></p>
<h2>Focused differentiation points:<br></h2>
<p>
<span>1. Meltdown Management<br>Matching sensitivity with occuring of meltdown<br></span>
Hypersensitivity is a common trait of those with autism; the individuals are prone to fits of rage or angst when triggers occur. The most common method to combat this utilizes a weighted vest, typically used in conjunction with an assistant aid; the idea is to put pressure on the individual to make them feel grounded, mimicking a hug. The issues lie in a heavy-weight of the vest, unsightly appearance, and inconvenience. <br><br>
 
<span>2. Meltdown Prediction<br>Clear demonstration by using the Zones of Regulation<br></span>
<img src="img/gaia/images/D1.png" width="100%"><br><br>
There is a common understanding that If we are able to recognize when we are becoming less regulated, we are able to do something about it to manage our feelings and get ourselves to a healthy place. This comes naturally for some, but for others(people with autism) it is a skill that needs to be taught and practiced. This is the goal of The Zones of Regulation (or Zones for short).<br> ​<br>

The Zones is a systematic, cognitive behavioral approach used to teach self-regulation by categorizing all the different ways we feel and states of alertness we experience into four concrete colored zones.  The Zones framework provides strategies to teach students to become more aware of and independent in controlling their emotions and impulses, manage their sensory needs, and improve their ability to problem solve conflicts. 

The color could be more direct and clear to show their current status without more learning cost.</p></div> <br><br>

<div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
There is no current solution focusing on matching factors caused a meltdown with a child with autism's sensitivity. If parents could manage meltdown causes, it would be helpful to reduce the exposure from dangerous elements and predict or prevent a meltdown.

</p>
<h1>Meltdown Prediction</h1>
<h2>Justification by Machine Learning<br></h2><br>
<p>
Through machine learning, the shirt will generate a threshold for of the metrics that are indicative of stress. Once the threshold baseline is surpassed the device initiates compression of the user, simulating a hug. <br><br>

</p>
<h1>Meltdown Managment</h1>
<h2>
Habit-building: </h2><br>
<p>
In addition, Gaia will increase the independence of the user, eliminating the need for an aide during day-to-day situations, such as work and school, thus reducing the financial burden on the family. The newfound independence will give the families of users peace of mind that Gaia provides support when they are unavailable. <br><br></p>
<h1>Meltdown Managment</h1>
<h2>
Clear daily/weekly/monthly Reports: <br></h2>
<p>
The mobile application provides a real-time display of the stress level of the user with a written queue to inform the user of what is happening. The application gives the user to manually initiate the compression, to strengthen the ability for the system to identify when the user is stressed.</p>
<div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
By habits building based on data collected by sensors and clear reports to show exact improvement or fluctuations, children would also learn and be willing to self-help and self-control based on accurate feedback and cause analysis.

<span>Discreetness:<br></span>
The benefits of Gaia lie in that it can be worn under clothing to avoid attention from peers.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
I do believe the common feature shared with other product couldn't be discarded since like multi biometrics collection could show a clearer difference of scare and stress. And discreetness is also a crucial consideration in product design depends on whether the users want to reveal their identity or not.
