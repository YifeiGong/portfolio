<p>Autistic caregivers are using printed paper cards or mobile apps to construct their kid's training plan, to practice social habits and communication skills.</p>

				<span>Paper cards are not durable, </span>since<br>
1. Cards are not easy to manage and store.<br>
2. If they lose one card,  the story would be less consistent. <br>
3. When caregivers bought several sets of cards, they would have many repetitive meaning cards.

			<img src="img/ss/images/D1.jpg" width="100%">
			<h3>Practicing with a real schedule and get reward points</h3>
			<img src="img/ss/images/D2.jpg" width="100%"><br> <br>
<p> 
	When at the activity time caregiver set, kids could see the [Currently On-going Activity] is active and tap it jump to [Story Page] to finish the corresponding stories. <br> <br>

After completed all the stories, kids earn points and could go back to the homepage. <br> <br>

Before the set time, when kids could only see the time of next activity on the top of the page, and it shows the time of it. But it is not tappable until the time.  </p>

			
		<h4>Homepage Layout and Style: Single Activity Card and List Design</h4>
		
			<img src="img/ss/images/D3.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>
			<p>At this point, the two columns design is not useful and clear as the one column since it's harder for kids to recognized and left/right layout. And the one column is more intuitive for time order schedule. <br><br>

And our strategy was going to provide some well-defined icons and also allow caregivers to upload icons or photos from their phones. So make the full image as the background has less expandability. <br><br>

To arrange the layout of icon, time, points, and name of the activity, I chose to finalize the design as left picture and right description layout, which is familiar and easy to understand. Thus when mingling our icons and customized photos, there won't be a mess-up.

						<h3>Challenge 3:<br>
HMW help children remember an activity while they are experiencing it?</h3>
<p><span>Abstract Picture Style</span><br>

<h4>Visual Design Iterations Based on Feedback</h4>
<img src="img/ss/images/D13.jpg" width="100%">
<h2>User Testing Learning</h2>
<p>Plan A has a light grey title for each activity which has worse discoverability and makes kids don't understand the whole sentence.<br><br>

Plan B has more compact information. But the left-right balance is worse and kids feel lose track when reading information on the right.<br><br>

Plan C's color code differentiates clearly types of cards but the list is a bit compact and overwhelm.<br><br>

Plan D has the clearest division so it's easier for kids to identify each activity.<br><br>

<h4>Homepage Final Design</h4>

<p>The final design shows in a todo list view. Activity and exercise respectively have different color code as blue and green. The bigger hero card is showing the ongoing or next event to notify users emphatically. </p>

And the checkmark is very important in this scenario since it could give kids an indicator whether the story has been completed or not.

						<h5>Challenges</h5>
      	<p><span>1. Define the core value and strategy</span><br>
The inital mobile app users were kids and caregivers. But after testing and redefining the core value of our solution, we decided to separate the caregiver's functions to a web portal. Thus kids could be more independent and immersive to complete activities by themselves, and a web portal also supports better our strategic plan of connecting professional therapists and local caregivers. <br><br>

<span>2. Test and define visual and motion style with ASD kids</span><br>
Testing with and getting feedback from children with autism were tough since they are sensitive, have a lower ability to self-report. Thus our first consideration of defining UI style was based on medical research of using abstract pictures. And the motion design was also developed based on principles like swift, lively, and responsive.
