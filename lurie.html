					<h5>Project Statement</h5>
		<h3>How Might We <br>Design a welcome experience for Lurie Children’s Hospital?</h3>
<p>This project seeks to <span>understand multiple stakeholder needs and explore new service opportunities</span> to be considered in the redesign of the reception space at Lurie Children’s Hospital. As designers, we should <span>consider all of the primary stakeholder groups, design new touchpoints as well as do testing and prototyping based on in-context research</span>.</p>

			When we talked to people, one thing poped up many times is that when they saw a long line in the waiting area on the sedond floor, it makes concierges feel stressful and patient family wonder are they going to be late for their appointment. <br><br></h3>
		</div>
		
		 

		 <h5>Overview</h5>

		<img src="img/lurie/images/R1.jpg" width="100%">
		<h5>Service Safari</h5>
		<p>Before the beginning of this course, We visited Capital One Cafe waiting area, CTA boarding, UA Flight Check-in, hotel check-in, and other places to understand the current utilization of technology in check-in service. After that, we came up with two by two frameworks to show the expecting service quality, and image Lurie is positioning itself. 
		
		<img src="img/lurie/images/R2.jpg" width="100%">
		<br><br>
		<span>Finding #1: <br>
		·Because of the hospital nature, although Lurie is facing younger patients, it may not requires a delightful experience. So that we should define the image of service Lurie wants to convey to the patient's families and, based on it, synthesize some design principles and develop design solutions.</span></p>

		<h5>Field Observation</h5>
<p>We visited Lurie independently and record our first image and experience as first-time visitors. Some existing touchpoints have excellent performance for wayfinding, and brand image building also has space for improvement. 
		<img src="img/lurie/images/R3.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>
		<span>Finding #2:<br>
		·Lurie is using a marine animal theme as the welcome experience to the patient's family. So we need to consider to make our deliverables fit in this theme or create a new visual system for them.<br>
		·The second-floor check-in has different objectives as the check-in experience at other places we visited.<br>
		·The expectation of second-floor check-in might be quick, light, and friendly.</span>
		
		
		<h5>Talking to Expert(s)</h5>
		We interviewed Barbara as our client with the perspective of representing the patient's family. 
Our topics with Cecillia focused more on the service and its quality of check-in experience. The goal of talking with experts was to understand their expectations from the enterprise side and consideration of regulation, management, security, and reputation.
		<img src="img/lurie/images/R4.jpg" width="100%">
		

		<h5>Interception and Semi-structured Interviews</h5>
		<p>We did 12 interviews by intercept the patient's family around the parking lot, the waiting  area, and cafe.</p>

		<img src="img/lurie/images/R5.jpg" width="100%">
		<p><span>
			Finding #4:<br>
			·The most frequent answers about the check-in on the second floor are about the check-in purpose, the time, necessity, and concierge's help. </span>

		</p>
		<h5>Survey Key Results</h5>
		<p>We conducted an online survey and sent out with the help of the patient's family experience department. We gathered 245 responses.</p>
		<img src="img/lurie/images/R7.jpg" width="100%"><br>
		<p><span>Finding #5:<br>
		·A long waiting line is not only a problem for concierges but also for patient families and visitors. It resulted in arriving and checking-in much earlier than the appointment time for them. </span>
		</p>
		<h5>How is it Currently Being Approached?</h5>
		<p>We understood the current user journey and service blueprint of the check-in experience from user's and hospital's persoectives. </p>
		<img src="img/lurie/images/R6.jpg" width="100%">
		<p><span>Finding #6:<br>
		A problem we met is that all of the check-in processes should be handled by concierges manually and waiting in one line so that concierges are providing the same quality at a similar speed. But the patient's family may have different expectations of the second-floor check-in. </span>
		</p>
		<h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
		<p>We visited Shirley Ryan Ability Lab in Chicago. They have amazing VI system design so that the physical signs, screens and facilities are all using the bright orange color in the building. </p>
<img src="img/lurie/images/R8.jpg" width="100%">
</div></p></div>

			      <div class="col-lg-6">
			      	 <div class="portfolio-details3">
			      	 	<p><span>Strengths</span><br>
			      	 		1. Striking and attractive lively branding leading by warm orange color<br>
2. Accessible digital screens at the primary wayfinding touchpoint like elevators and stair hallway<br>
3. Has concierges around the check-in area providing help with a smile<br>
			      	 	</p>
			      	 	<p><span>Opportunities</span><br>
			      	 		1. Better check-in platform UI design<br>
			      	 		2. Access to self-security
			      	 	</p>
			      	 </div>
			    </div>
			     <div class="col-lg-6">
			      	 <div class="portfolio-details3">
			      	 	<p><span>Weaknesses</span><br>
			      	 		1. The check-on system UI is basic without well-design flow and structure<br>
2.No waiting line in the waiting area might cause chaos when during rush hour<br>
3. Without screening, everyone could enter the 18th floors and some other levels<br>
4. No clear sign for parking ticket stamping
			      	 </p>
			      	 	<p><span>Threats</span><br>
			      	 		1. The check-in space is on the 18th floor, which is confusing for first-time visitors. 
2. No security screening by registering an ID would bring safe issues.
			      	 	</p>

		<p>
			<span>Solution 1 User Story</span><br><br>
There is a digital screen to show a QR code updating every day on Lurie's second-floor wall. Visitors could scan by smartphone when they are onsite and enter a six digits appointment code to check-in. Then they could get a digital badge on the phone.

<p>

<span>Solution 2 User Story</span><br><br>
There are some kiosks on Lurie's second floor with an iPad. Visitors could scan their QR code on their phone, appointment confirmation letter by a scanner, and confirm their appointment to check-in. Then they could get a printed badge. 
<br><br>

			    <div class="col-lg-12">
			        <div class="portfolio-details3">
			        	<h3>Decision</h3>
			        	<p>We decided to explore the solution 2 further, since:  <br> <br>
                            1. Lurie couldn't change the policy of printing badge and attach it to cloth for screening by security or help on each floor. <br>
                            2. Solution 1 requires a more open space, which is not feasible for Lurie since there are large bearing columns around the circle table. </p>
			        	<h5>HOW?</h5>
<p>Trying to make a new check-in lane works for a specific group of people.</p>


<img src="img/lurie/images/B3.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">


<p>We thought Outpatient Family would suit those requirements. Reasons and feasibilities are below:<br><br>
1. Outpatient families take 70-80% number of daily appointments at Lurie. <br>
2. Their check-in process without a background which needs to check in another separate system check is relatively simple so that cost less efforts. <br>
3. And the visit instruction for them is highly-standardized.</p>

 <div class="container">
      <p>The most challenge part of this project was the technical solution part. To get a better output, I chose a solution which could not be programmed by myself. But with the help of an engineer, we finally got a good actualization and tested it successfully.<br><br>

I applied for a patent after graduation. Moreover, based on the wire in the smart material and solar energy system, the volume of lurie system could be reduced dramatically. Thus it could be more convenient to assemble on the clothes and cheap for the users.
